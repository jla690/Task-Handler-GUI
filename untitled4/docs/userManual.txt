The GUI can be run by running the main function in the Main class in the a4 directory.

There, you can
select the tabs to choose which tasks you want to show: "All", "Upcoming", or "Overdue" tasks.

In the "All" tasks you can
click on the checkbox in order to complete the task and you can click "Remove Task" to delete it.

Pressing "Add Task" will open a popup window where you can create a new task.

You can type the name and notes of your task into the text boxes right
in the text fields and select the date and time by choosing it in the dropdown menu.

If you do not fill in all the fields, then an error will popup telling you to
fill in all the required fields.

Clicking "Generate" will create a random task for you.

The "Cancel" will close the window and send you back to the main window.

The "Create" button will create the task and add it to your list of tasks.
